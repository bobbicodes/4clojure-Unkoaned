;; 71 Rearranging Code: ->

-> threads expression x through a variable number of forms.
x is inserted as second item in first form,
making a list of it if it is not a list already.
Then the first form is inserted as second item in second form,
making a list of that form if necessary.
This process continues for all the forms.
Makes code more readable.
