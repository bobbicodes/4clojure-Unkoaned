(defn contains?
  "Returns true if key is in coll,
  false if not.
  For numerically indexed collections
  like vectors and Java arrays,
  this tests if the numeric key is
  within the range of indexes.
  'contains?' operates constant
  or logarithmic time;
  it won't do a linear search for a value.
